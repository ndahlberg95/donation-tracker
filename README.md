User Story: 

AS A DONATION COORDINATOR AT A LOCAL NON-PROFIT,
I WANT TO TRACK INVENTORY OF DONATED GOODS SO THAT 
I CAN EASILY VISUALIZE OUR NEEDS.

Acceptance Criteria: 

GIVEN A DONATION TRACKING PLATFORM
WHEN I INPUT INFORMATION INTO A FIELD
THEN I AM ABLE TO SEE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DONATIONS I HAVE INPUT 
AS WELL AS WHICH ITEMS I HAVE THE MOST OF 
AND WHICH ITEMS I HAVE THE LEAST OF.

PLANS FOR THE FUTURE: 

GOOGLE API GRAPH WILL BE DYNAMIC BASED ON SERVER STORAGE INFO.
ABILITY TO EXPORT INFO TO CSV WHEN NEEDED.
TIMESTAMPING FOR WHEN DONATION WAS INPUT.
DONATION ITEM AND AMOUNT ENTRY. 
GIPHY API ADD and CORRECT.
