User Story: 

AS A DONATION COORDINATOR AT A LOCAL NON-PROFIT,
I WANT TO TRACK INVENTORY OF DONATED GOODS SO THAT 
I CAN EASILY VISUALIZE OUR NEEDS.

Acceptance Criteria: 

GIVEN A DONATION TRACKING PLATFORM
WHEN I INPUT INFORMATION INTO A FIELD
THEN I AM ABLE TO SEE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DONATIONS I HAVE INPUT 
AS WELL AS WHICH ITEMS I HAVE THE MOST OF 
AND WHICH ITEMS I HAVE THE LEAST OF.

PLANS FOR THE FUTURE: 

GOOGLE API GRAPH WILL BE DYNAMIC BASED ON SERVER STORAGE INFO
ABILITY TO EXPORT INFO TO CSV WHEN NEEDED
TIMESTAMPING FOR WHEN DONATION WAS INPUT
DONATION ITEM AND AMOUNT ENTRY.
